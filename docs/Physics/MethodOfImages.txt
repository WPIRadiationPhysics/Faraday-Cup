  The solid copper cylinder is a grounded conductor with permittivity
ε_Cu, the Kapton encasement is an insulator with permittivity ε_KA, and

  Φ(r=r_Cu, z<=h_Cu) = Φ(r<=r_Cu, z=h_Cu) = Φ(r=r_KA) = Φ(z=h_KA) = 0.

A particle of charge Z is a point source at Q, (r*, z*), such that

          r_Cu < r* < r_KA,   and   h_Cu < z* < h_KA.

The surface charge density of the conductor changes due to the presence
of a nearby point source, which changes the potential inside the conductor
to be nonzero.  We may approximate this effect using the Method of Images-
This technique assumes a "mirrored images" of electrostatic potential
between the inside and outside, which converge to zero along the boundaries
of the conductor.  Thus, the potential inside the conductor can be approximated
by a point charge Z' located at Q', (r',z'), where

                 r' < r_Cu,   and   z' < h_Cu.
