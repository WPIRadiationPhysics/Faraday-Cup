Purpose: To design a Portable Faraday Cup (PFC) for calibration of proton accelerators (50 to 250 MeV). The PFC must be accurate to 1% and practical, hence vacuum-less and of low mass.  Experimental data are utilized as a means of validating model simulations.

Methods: Copper was chosen as the detector core, coated with a Kapton insulating film and silver ground.  Kapton functions to capture backscattered electrons, the role of the fields in a standard Faraday Cup.  The Monte Carlo method was used to simulate the radiation cascade and predict the net charge of the PFC per proton input (gain) versus insulator thickness and beam energy.  Charge displacements involving Kapton follow a linear proportionality to the origin/terminus depth toward the outer ground layer.

Results: Gain is nearly linearly proportional to beam energy.  Kapton thickness and silver ground addition increases both capture and secondary electron in-leakage, which decrease gain.

Conclusion: Electron backscatter output from MCNP6 indicate an outdated low-energy cross-section library.  A Faraday Cup design with an optimized Kapton thickness was evaluated using Geant4; beyond X microns, different Kapton thicknesses result in statistically indistinguishable gains.
