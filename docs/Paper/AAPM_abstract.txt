Purpose: To design a Portable Faraday Cup (PFC) for calibration of therapy-range proton accelerators (50 to 250 MeV). The PFC must be accurate to 1% and practical, hence vacuum-less and of low mass.

Methods: Copper was chosen as the detector core, coated with a Kapton insulating film and silver ground. The Monte Carlo method (MCNP6 and Geant4) was used to simulate the radiation cascade and predict gain versus height (H), diameter (D) and insulator thickness (K); both are proportional to mass and inversely so to proton leakage, and thus decreases detector accuracy. A secondary electron model was programmed with the SDEF command for the MCNP model based on recently published cross-section approximations.

Results: Kapton functions to capture backscattered electrons, the function of the fields in a standard Faraday Cup. Greater K increases capture but increases secondary electron in-leakage. Determining optimal K was made difficult by the lack of low energy proton and electron cross-sections.

Conclusion: Theoretical values obtained through Geant4 encompass emperical data from model Faraday cups. Electron backscatter output from MCMP6 indicate an outdated low-energy cross-section library. Overall positive outlook in simulating pencil-beam scanning therapy dose equivalence.
