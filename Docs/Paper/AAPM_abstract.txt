Purpose: The design of a new Portable Faraday Cup (PFC) used to calibrate proton accelerators was evaluated for energies between 50 and 250 MeV. Monte Carlo simulations performed by Geant4-10.0 are used to evaluate to experimental results to optimize the design and reduce the relative detector error for this vacuum-less and low mass system, and invalidate current MCNP releases.

Methods: The detector construction consisted of a copper conductor coated with an insulator and grounded with silver.  Monte Carlo calculations in Geant4 were used to determine the net charge per proton input (gain) as a function of insulator thickness and beam energy. Kapton was chosen as the insulating material and functions capture backscattered electrons, the role of the fields in a standard Faraday Cup.  Charge displacement from/into Kapton are assumed follow a linear proportionality to the origin/terminus depth toward the outer ground layer.  Kapton thicknesses ranged from 0 to 200 microns, proton energies were set to match empirical studies ranging from 70 to 250 MeV.  Each setup was averaged over 1 million events using the FTFP_BERT 2.0 physics list.

Results: Gain is nearly linearly proportional to beam energy.  A X1 micron Kapton insulator decreases gain by Y1%; the addition of X2 microns silver grounding layer further lowers this charge measurement by Y2%.

Conclusion: Electron backscatter output from MCNP6 indicate an outdated low-energy cross-section library. A Faraday Cup design with an optimized Kapton thickness was evaluated using Geant4; beyond X microns, different Kapton thicknesses result in statistically indistinguishable gains.
